Characterstics of pure functions
 
- Given the same arguments, the function always calculates and returns same result
- When calculating the result, the function doesnt cause any observable side effect.

simply we can say that pure functions dont depend on, and dont modify anything outside </br>
its scope, and do always return the same result for the same input arguments
